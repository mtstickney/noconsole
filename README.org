* About
  This is a small program for Windows to run console applications
  with the console window initially hidden. This avoids the quick
  flash of console window normally associated with hiding the window,
  without removing the window entirely (it can be restored at any time
  with =ShowWindow=).

  =noconsole= is primarily useful for applications that have a GUI but
  open a console window anyway (saved Lisp images, for example). GUI
  applications should also work normally, though =noconsole= won't
  really do anything useful.

* Usage
  : noconsole.exe <program_name> [<args>...]

* Building
  Using the MSVC compiler:
  : cl.exe noconsole.c
  Using MinGW, something like:
  : gcc -o noconsole noconsole.c -static
